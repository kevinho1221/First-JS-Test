# First-JS-Test
Just my first javascript file following a tutorial

Notes:
-ctr+L to clear console
-cmd+opt+i to bring up console in browser
-all numbers are numbers, no float vs integer
-dyanmic language: types of variables can be change, so a variable can be a string and you can change it to a number later
-Arrays can have their lengths adjusted, you can also store diferent type of variables in the same array, an array can have both strings and numbers
